#Given the mass flow rate
length of pipe
roughness factor
density of fluid
diameter of pipe
viscosity of fluid
accelertaion due to gravity 
#this programme calculates the frcitional losses with frciton factor from the colebrook equation which is 
# 1/f^0.5 + 2*log10((eb/3.7)+(5.51/(re*(f^0.5)))) for turbulent flow 
# 64/re for laminar flow
The reynolds number is 522.1191 
It is in laminar region since 522.1191 is below 2000 
the friction factor obtained is   0.1226 
The head losses are calculated   0.0491
